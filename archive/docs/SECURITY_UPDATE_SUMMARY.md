## Latest Update: 2025-08-15

## Overview
Comprehensive security improvements addressing multiple vulnerabilities identified in SEMGREP.md security analysis. Implementation includes SSH host key verification, command injection prevention, and enhanced AS number validation - providing defense-in-depth protection for production deployments.

## Security Implementations

### 1. SSH Host Key Verification ✅ (2025-08-14)
**Risk Level**: HIGH → RESOLVED

#### New Security Module

#### Security Features
- Prevents shell command injection through malicious AS numbers
- Rejects invalid AS number types (floats, strings, negative values)
- Sanitizes policy names to prevent injection via special characters
- Validates AS numbers as 32-bit unsigned integers within RFC range
- Clear error messages for debugging while maintaining security

### 3. Enhanced AS Number Validation ✅ (2025-08-15)

- AS number validation edge cases (negative, overflow, type errors)
- Policy name injection attempts (semicolons, pipes, backticks, etc.)
- RFC-compliant AS range validation with reserved range warnings
- BGPq3 wrapper integration testing with security validation

## Security Improvements Summary

### 1. SSH Host Key Verification
**Before (VULNERABLE)**:
```python
ssh_client.set_missing_host_key_policy(paramiko.AutoAddPolicy())
```
- Accepts ANY host key without verification
- Vulnerable to MITM attacks
- No audit trail of accepted keys

**After (SECURE)**:
```python
host_key_policy = get_host_key_policy(setup_mode=self.setup_mode)
ssh_client.set_missing_host_key_policy(host_key_policy)
```
- Strict verification against pre-collected known_hosts
- Rejects unknown hosts in production
- Setup mode only for initial deployment
- Full audit trail and logging

### 2. Command Injection Prevention
**Before (VULNERABLE)**:
```python
command.extend(['-Jl', policy_name, f'AS{as_number}'])
```
- No input validation before shell command construction
- Vulnerable to injection via malicious AS numbers or policy names
- Could execute arbitrary commands through crafted inputs

**After (SECURE)**:
```python
validated_as = validate_as_number(as_number)
policy_name = validate_policy_name(policy_name)
command.extend(['-Jl', policy_name, f'AS{validated_as}'])
```
- Strict validation of all inputs before command construction
- AS numbers validated as 32-bit unsigned integers (0-4294967295)
- Policy names sanitized to alphanumeric, underscore, hyphen only
- Clear error messages for invalid inputs

### 3. Enhanced AS Number Validation
**Before (BASIC)**:
```python
if self.min_as_number <= as_num <= self.max_as_number:
    as_numbers.add(as_num)
```
- Simple range checking only
- No RFC compliance validation
- No reserved range awareness

**After (RFC-COMPLIANT)**:
```python
validation_result = self._validate_as_number_strict(as_num, line[:50])
if validation_result['valid']:
    as_numbers.add(as_num)
    # Warnings for reserved ranges logged
```
- RFC-compliant AS number validation
- Reserved range detection and warnings
- IP octet filtering (≤255)
- Comprehensive logging with context

## Production Deployment Process

1. **Initial Setup** (one-time):
   ```bash
   # Collect host keys from all routers
   ./scripts/setup-host-keys.sh /var/lib/bgp-toolkit/config/devices.csv \
                                /var/lib/bgp-toolkit/ssh-keys/known_hosts
   
   # Verify fingerprints
   ssh-keygen -l -f /var/lib/bgp-toolkit/ssh-keys/known_hosts
   ```

2. **Production Configuration**:
   - Ensure `BGP_TOOLKIT_SETUP_MODE` is NOT set
   - Known_hosts file at `/var/lib/bgp-toolkit/ssh-keys/known_hosts`
   - SSH will reject any unknown hosts

3. **Maintenance**:
   - When routers are replaced, update known_hosts
   - Use setup scripts to add new devices
   - Keep audit log of all changes

### 4. Remaining SEMGREP Recommendations
The following lower-priority items from SEMGREP.md remain available for future implementation:
- Secure credential storage (encrypted storage option)
- Secure temporary file creation (restricted permissions)
- Logging sanitization (sensitive data redaction)
