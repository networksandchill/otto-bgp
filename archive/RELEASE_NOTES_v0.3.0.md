## 📋 Migration Guide

### From v0.2.0 to v0.3.0

#### 1. Backup Current Setup
```bash
# Backup existing data
sudo cp -r /var/lib/otto-bgp /var/lib/otto-bgp.v0.2.0.backup
sudo cp -r /etc/otto-bgp /etc/otto-bgp.v0.2.0.backup
```

#### 2. Enhance CSV Files
Add hostname column to device CSV files:
```csv
# Before (v0.2.0)
address,username
192.168.1.1,admin

# After (v0.3.0)
address,hostname,username
192.168.1.1,edge-router-01,admin
```

#### 3. Update CLI Commands
```bash
# Old command structure
otto-bgp process devices.csv

# New router-aware structure
otto-bgp discover devices.csv --output-dir policies
otto-bgp policy sample_input.txt --output-dir policies/routers
```

#### 4. Configure Router Discovery
Create discovery configuration:
```bash
# Generate initial router mappings
otto-bgp discover devices.csv --output-dir policies
```

### Backward Compatibility
- Legacy CSV format supported (auto-generates hostnames)
- Single-router mode available via CLI flags
- Existing policy files can be migrated automatically
